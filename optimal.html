    <p>
        This algorithms replaces the page which will not be referred for so long in future. Although it can
         not be practically implementable but it can be used as a benchmark. Other algorithms are compared 
         to this in terms of optimality.The theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm 
         (also known as OPT, clairvoyant replacement algorithm, or Bélády's optimal page replacement policy)
          is an algorithm that works as follows: when a page needs to be swapped in, the operating system 
          swaps out the page whose next use will occur farthest in the future.
