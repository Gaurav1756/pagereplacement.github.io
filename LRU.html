    <P>
        This algorithm replaces the page which has not been referred for a long time. This algorithm is 
        just opposite to the optimal page replacement algorithm. The LRU stands for the Least Recently Used.
         It keeps track of page usage in the memory over a short period of time. It works on the concept 
         that pages that have been highly used in the past are likely to be significantly used again in the
          future. It removes the page that has not been utilized in the memory for the longest time. 
          LRU is the most widely used algorithm because it provides fewer page faults than the other methods.
